### What is Scenario?
Scenarios is a descriptions of events or interactions that occur in a system or application. Scenarios are typically written in the form of a story that explains how the system or application works and how users can use it.

Scenarios are commonly used in the development of a system or application to help determine the specifications and criteria that the system or application must meet. By having a clear and well-defined collection of scenarios, development teams can easily develop the system or application to meet the needs of users and the established criteria.

```gherkin

Scenario: [Scenario name]

```
